              I have a rich employment history in customer service, with a sprinkling of healthcare and sales in-between. I have always sought and found a way to influence each position I have held with empathy, passion, and a never-give-up mindset. 'Never give up' means to me that even when you are at your lowest, you pause and allow yourself a moment, then you get back up and persist. This frame of mind has helped me get through some of the lowest points in my life.
              <br />
              <br />
              The one thing I have always wanted is to really make a difference and work in an industry where I can also have a creative outlet. After sacrificing time, money, and lots of hard work, I have found it. I look forward to entering the tech industry as a Full-Stack Web Developer. I am open to similar or adjacent positions.
